			<p>My name is Lyle, I’m currently a final year university student studying Cyber Security and Networks. I hail from and still live in Scotland, the land of Kilts, Red Heads and Whiskey. The inception of this blog originally started as a way of sharing: what I have learned, what I am currently learning and highlighting topics I have an interest in. In the somewhat short 2-3 week period of time it took to have this blog ready, that idea had shifted somewhat.</p>

<p>While the core ideas still stands, I want to share, the scope of what that goal became wider and wider the more I pondered it. So this won’t be solely a technology blog, from time to time I plan on sprinkling in some other content about my thoughts, philosophy and life. While technology is great, i’ve spent the last 4 years studying different areas of it and my career for the foreseeable future will more than likely revolve around it. It’s important to keep in mind that it is not everything. There is a whole world out there of people, ideas and experiances to be had.</p>

<p><strong>What I’m essentially trying to say is standup, go outside and touch grass.</strong>
<br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>To start off with the obvious, technology. You either love it, hate it or its part of your job (so you love and hate it). But my interest in tech is pretty wide, ranging from phyiscally working with it (building computers), security aspects (both offensive and defensive work alike) and a small amount of programming (consisting mostly of scripting and automation). I’m also a massive gamer.</p>

<p>Taking a step away from computers, I enjoy keeping healthy. Mainly this consists of recreational powerlifting in the gym and the occasional trip to the cardio room to make sure the old heart keeps on ticking along. I also thouroughly enjoy the outdoors, anything I can do outside. Wither it be walking, mountain biking or snowboarding. If I can do it outdoors, I will sure give it a solid try.</p>

<p>Another recent interest of mine has been movies, specifically “older” movies. Have you ever thought about how many great films were made before you could understand them fully or before you were even born. I personally picked 2010 as may end date, now any movies I hear about, stumble across or am recommended that were released prior to 2010 go straight onto the list.
<br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="life-view">Life View</h3>

<p>May general view of life is heavily influenced by the Stoic philosophy which I personally modified with ideas from the Japanese Bushido Code as well as a small bit of Nihilism. Most of this can be boiled down to: If I can not directly control the outcome of an event then why should I fell anything but indifference towards said outcome.</p>

<p>From around the age of 17, I have had an interest in self-improvement. This has lead to somewhat of a min/max approach to life, in that if I find something that isn’t serving me in life I will remove without so much as a second thought. This is one of the reasons that I live rather frugally, save money in everywhere so I can focus on what I really enjoy.
<br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="rapid-fire">Rapid Fire</h3>

<p>This section will be some quick fire fact:</p>

<p><strong>Cooking</strong>: I really enjoy cooking, its a great way to slow down and enjoy the process of making something. Plus who doesn’t love eating great food.</p>

<p><strong>Reading</strong>: I started reading books again at the start of my 20’s, it’s one of the best decisions I have made. Self-Improvement, Fantasy or  biographies. I may not be the fastest reader but who cares.</p>

<p><strong>Music</strong>: I love music, if i’m doing something that doesn’t require absolute focus, then will most likley be found with headphones on. Almost anything goes, with the exception of pop/chart music, you will find a wide span of generes in one of my many playlists.</p>

<p><strong>Routines</strong>: With the vast amount of tech we use on a daily basis, its important to remember to get away from them from time to time. Personally I enjoy tesing out new routines and ideas to try and limit the use of tech.</p>
