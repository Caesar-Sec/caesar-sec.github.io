Before diving head first into cryptocurrencies, it may be a good idea to first understand the basics of what they are and some common terms which are used in discussions about crypto.

To strip crypto back down to its most basic definition, it is a decentralized digital currency. Similar the cash you probably use on a daily basis, it can be used to buy products and services, it can be traded for different currencies and in some cases can be "staked" in return for passive income like that provided by a savings account. Where crypto starts to diverge is when the decentralized part of the definition of considered. Standard currency like the GBP or the USD are maintained by a single entity, these are often known as Central Banks, such as the Bank of England in the UK. The Bank of England is owned by the British Government and will operate at the behest of government or more specifically the treasury department.

Cryptocurrency takes this idea of Central Banks and throws it out of the window. Decentralization means that the cryptocurrency is not controlled by a single authority, instead sharing ownership publicly and in the case of cryptocurrency shared with the whole world using the blockchain.

## Blockchains

To manage these decentralized currencies and keep track of all its transaction records, a blockchain is used. A blockchain can be thought of like ledger book, each page of the book has a set amount of lines and each transaction is recorded on a new line. Once the page has been filled you move on to the next page. In a blockchain each of these pages would be known as a "Block" and each block has a limited number of entries it can hold. Once a block has been filled it is closed and it is linked to all of the previously filled blocks, these connected blocks are known as a blockchain.

In order to maintain the integrity of the blockchain each transaction need to be validated before it is considered confirmed. When a transaction is made, for example a person tries to buy some bitcoin, this transaction is broadcast to all of the computers who are connected the the bitcoin network which are called "nodes". Each of these nodes try to complete a mathematic equation in order to validate the transaction. When the transaction is validated it is stored in the block, thus completing the transaction.

## Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are two different methods that are used when validating transaction on the blockchain. The Proof of Work method was detailed in the previous section, where the nodes on the cryptocurrencies network race to solve complex mathematical equations to validate transactions. In return for lending their computing power to the network, the node which is able to create the new block on the chain is rewarded with some of the cryptocurrency for that given network.

Proof of Stake on the other hand incentivises users to hold more of the networks token in order to contribute to the validation process. Users must "stake" a portion of the coins that they own in order to be eligible to validate transactions. Staking is like locking away your coins in an account, the more of the coin that you lock away the greater the chance of winning the reward for creating the next block. The reward in this case would be the transaction fee which is required to make any transactions on the blockchain.

## Common Coins

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, developed by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous figure who developed the coin to further his idea of a new financial system. A financial system which would do away with the requirement for government controlled Central Banks and instead using a decentralized peer-to-peer system. When bitcoin was created the maximum supply was restricted to 21 million.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. It was released six years after bitcoin in 2015, however unlike bitcoin, Ethereum was not solely built as a digital currency. Instead Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform, allowing users of the network to build apps and projects on its network. The Ethereum network is host to two large projects: DeFi and Dapps. Which stand for Decentralized Finance and Decentralized Apps respectively.

### Monero

Monero is a coin similar to bitcoin with one major benefit, privacy. As explained previously the blockchain is like a ledger book and as this ledger is public, any transactions on the blockchain can be searched and tracked. Enter Monero, as long as care is taken when buying and storing your monero any payment you make should be completely private.

## Stablecoins, Coins and Tokens

As mentioned in the above section when it comes to cryptocurrencies, not every coin is considered as a form of currency. Utility tokens, like Ethereum, are not a type of currency. Instead they are meant to grant some kind of utility or usefulness in relation to they blockchain they are tied to. This could be to allow access to an application which is being built or hosted on the blockchain or to interact with that application.

Stablecoins are a specific type of cryptocurrency which are used to counteract the instability of crypto prices. This stability is achieved by backing the stablecoin with an asset which already has the desired stability built-in. Most stablecoins are backed or pegged against the USD, but this is not always the case other coins may choose to back against a number of different assets. If a stablecoin states that it is backed 1:1 with the USD, it means that for every one of that stablecoins that exist there should be a dollar stored in a reserve to back it.

A basic rule of thumb is that Coins are currency, Tokens provide Utility and Stablecoins provide stability in the markets.

## Quick Fire Jargon

To finish off this short post covering the basics of cryptocurrencies, the following list should provide some terms or phrases that are sometimes used then talking about crypto currencies:

- Fiat - government issued currency, which derives its value from the fact the government declared that it is to be legal tender. This includes USD, GBP, EUR.
- Alt Coin - these cover any cryptocurrency which is not Bitcoin.
- FUD - Short for "Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt". This is sometimes levied at people who talk negatively or expose wrongdoing in regards to a crypto project.
- KYC - Short for "Know your Customer". These checks are required by most crypto exchanges to meet government regulations and aid with Anti-Money-Laundering Laws (AML).
- Wallet - a storage medium for cryptocurrencies. These wallets can be either hardware wallets or software wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices which look similar to a USB. Software wallets have more options including: desktop or mobile wallets which are stored on you computer or smartphone respectively, as well as web wallets in which funds are accessed using a web browser.

## Conclusion

I hope that this short blog post was able to help you understand some of the basics of cryptocurrencies. I intend to make this into a series of post documenting and explaining different areas of the crypto space.
