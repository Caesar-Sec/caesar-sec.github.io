Welcome to my blog.

I plan to write about a number of areas that are of interest to me.

From technology and cybersecurity, with the occastional dip into some life and philosophy.

So if any or all of these topics are of interest to you, dive in and see what posts peak your interest.

Finally, I hope that after reading any one of these post you can leave having learned something new or consider a new perspective.
