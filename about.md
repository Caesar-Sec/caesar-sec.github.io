My name is Lyle, I'm currently a final year university student studying Cyber Security and Networks. I hail from Scotland, the land of Kilts, Red Heads and Whiskey. The inception of this blog originally started as a way of sharing: what I have learned, what I am currently learning and to further develop my knowledge. In the short time it took to have this blog ready, that idea had changed.

While the core ideas still stands, I want to learn and share that knowledge. The scope of that goal became wider and wider the more I considered it. So this won't be solely a technology blog, from time to time I plan on sprinkling in some other content about my thoughts, philosophy and life. While technology is great, I’ve spent the last 4 years studying different areas of it and my career for the foreseeable future will more than likely revolve around it. It's important to keep in mind that it is not everything, there are so many experiences to have and ideas to explore. So every now and then remember to go outside and touch some grass.

## Interests

To start off with the obvious, technology. My interest in tech is pretty wide, ranging from physically working with it (building computers), security aspects (both offensive and defensive work alike) and a small amount of programming (consisting mostly of scripting and automation). Every now and then I may be found playing some video games.

Taking a step away from computers, I enjoy keeping healthy. Mainly this consists of recreational powerlifting in the gym and the occasional run. I also thoroughly enjoy the outdoors, anything I can do outside. Wither it be walking, mountain biking or snowboarding. If I can do it outdoors, I will sure give it a solid try.

Another recent interest of mine has been movies, specifically "older" movies. Have you ever thought about how many great films and TV shows were made before you could understand them fully or before you were even born. I have stated to compile an ever expanding list of movies and TV shows which came out before 2012, and slowly making my way through the list. If anyone ever reads this and has a good recommendation, feel free to send it my way via twitter or by email.

## Life View

My general view of life is heavily influenced by the Stoic philosophy which I learned from reading both Mediations by Marcus Aurelius and Letters from a Stoic by Seneca. To sum up this view, only things and events directly within a persons control should be considered good or bad. While anything outside of your control should be seen as indifferent.

## Rapid Fire

This section will be some quick fire fact:

**Cooking**: I really enjoy cooking, its a great way to slow down and enjoy the process of making something. Plus who doesn't love eating great food.

**Reading**: I started reading books again at the start of my 20's, it's one of the best decisions I have made. Self-Improvement, Fantasy or  biographies.

**Music**: I love music, if I’m doing something that doesn't require absolute focus, then will most likely be something on Spotify. Really anything goes except for pop and chart music.
